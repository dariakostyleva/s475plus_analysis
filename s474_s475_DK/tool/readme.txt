some macros for quick analysis during engineering run 2019

1) intensity (YT)
 - to analyze correlation between different scaler counts
   for intensity calibration

2) tofcalib (YT)
 - to determine tof calibration parameters

3) tpccalib (YT)
 - TPC calibration

4) tactcalib (few people)
 - export the spectra in go4 and run the script. Two options with or without edges
